# VerificationBot

Bot created for verification for one of my class's server. It has a channel where every time a new person joins, an already existing person who knows them can verify them. It then logs who verifies each person in the log channel.

It also has a freeze nickname functionality to make sure people keep their nicknames as their irl name

The bot runs on a raspberry pi 2b+
